CAMERA SETUP GUIDE
========================================

You have multiple video devices. Here's how to configure:

STEP 1: Test Which Cameras Work
--------------------------------
Run the camera test script:

    python3 test_cameras.py

This will:
- Test camera indices 0-3
- Show preview of each working camera
- Tell you which indices to use


STEP 2: Update config.json
---------------------------
Based on your video devices, you likely have:
- /dev/video0 - First camera
- /dev/video1 - Second camera (or another stream)

Edit config.json:

    nano config.json

Update these lines:
    "driver_cam_index": 0,    ← Change to working camera index
    "road_cam_index": 1,      ← Change to second camera (or same as driver)


COMMON CONFIGURATIONS:
----------------------
If you have 2 separate USB cameras:
    "driver_cam_index": 0,
    "road_cam_index": 1

If you have 1 camera with multiple streams:
    "driver_cam_index": 0,
    "road_cam_index": 0    (same camera for both)

If test_cameras.py shows cameras at 0 and 2:
    "driver_cam_index": 0,
    "road_cam_index": 2


QUICK TEST:
-----------
1. Run: python3 test_cameras.py
2. Note which indices work (e.g., 0 and 1)
3. Edit config.json with those indices
4. Run: python3 main.py


TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
❌ Camera not working?
   → Check permissions: sudo usermod -a -G video $USER
   → Log out and back in
   → Try: v4l2-ctl --list-devices

❌ Permission denied?
   → Add user to video group: sudo usermod -a -G video $USER
   → Log out and back in, or: newgrp video

❌ Too many video devices?
   → Usually /dev/video0 and /dev/video1 are the main cameras
   → Other numbers might be metadata streams
   → Test with test_cameras.py to find working ones
